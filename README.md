Luhn CreditCard Validator - FunctionalKats January 2015
=======================================================

The unit tests use ScalaTest and ScalaCheck.  

ScalaCheck (which is equivalent to Haskell's QuickCheck) is a testing framework which allows automatic generation of inputs for your test.

My CreditCard generators randomly generates 100 valid creditcards and 100 invalid creditcards.
